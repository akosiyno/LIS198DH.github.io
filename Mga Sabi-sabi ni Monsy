Nathalie Cecire takes stock of the hack vs. yack debate, which permeates the various articles in the *Journal to Digital Humanities*. She discusses the postlapsarian context of DH and the resulting proliferation of knowledge modalities, which necessitate DH as an epistemology of doing.

What is interesting in Thomas' account is the new forms of digital scholarship under the auspices of DH.

Schmidt succintly discusses how theory must be the basis of DH (although, isn't DH a theory itself?).

There's this other nice guy who's talking about how central collaboration is in DH. Basta, we can learn reading code daw. And he's advocating critical code studies.

And then Bauer rants. A lot. "The archive is the theory!"
